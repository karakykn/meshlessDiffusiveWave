- In order to match the simple case diffusion results to that of dynamic wave, the friction
slopes are evalatued using wide rectangular channel assumption. The modifications correspond 
to line 414 and 326.
- The diffusive limit is changed from 1e3 to 1e4 and 1e6. 1e4 results show better attenuation
and it gets closer to diffusive wave results. However 1e6 approximated results worse than
1e4. My take on the matter was that it is better to not to limit diffusivity so that the
model would behave closer to what happens real. Therefore, I suspect that errors due to time
integration may play a role. Change dt for the same diffusivity limit and see.
- I changed dt to a 5 times lower number and didn't observe any changes in simple case n40
diflim 1e3. This result makes my initial guess on the matter a better approach. However,
I should find why the results diverge as I increase the diffusivity limit from 1e4 to 1e6

- Normal depth for downstream boundary is added. Don't forget to change the downstream boundary
accordingly before the run.

- After implementing the stability condition for regular finite difference scheme to meshless, the model converges
with CFL=0.3, irrespective of diffusive limits on synthetic rectangular channel.
- The model converges with CFL=0.25 on simpleCase.
- Consider doing a stability analysis on meshless and bound dt accordingly. If apriori stability condition is found,
it can be implemented in the solver. However, aposteriori stability condition would require the computation of
the eigenvalues of system matrix at every time step. This would increase the runtime, but make sure solutions
converge no matter what.
- It is better to use stab. condition for finite difference scheme and limit CFL around 0.25 or lower. This will
ensure convergence without any computational burden. However, there might be cases where the model do not converge.
In such cases, lowering CFL further would do.
